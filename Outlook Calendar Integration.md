## Overview

The Outlook Calendar Integration for Orion addresses a critical need in the contract furniture dealer industry by bridging the gap between individual scheduling and project management. This solution seamlessly synchronizes pertinent events from dealers' Outlook calendars with NetSuite, ensuring that project-related activities are visible and trackable within the broader organizational context.

By integrating Outlook calendars with NetSuite, we enable better team collaboration, improve project visibility, and maintain business continuity. This integration ensures that important project milestones, client meetings, and other relevant events are automatically reflected in NetSuite, allowing for more accurate project tracking and resource management, even when key personnel are unavailable.

## Design (UI/UX overview)

1. Automatic Sync:
    
    - Events are automatically synced based on predefined criteria (e.g., specific keywords, attendees, or categories)
        
    - No direct user interaction required for the default sync process
        
2. Outlook Tagging System:
    
    - Custom tags or categories in Outlook to control sync behavior
        
    - "Sync to NetSuite" and "Do Not Sync" tags available for user selection
        
    - Visual indicators in Outlook to show sync status of events
        
3. NetSuite Event View:
    
    - Dedicated dashboard or sublist within relevant NetSuite records (e.g., customer, project, or transaction records) to display synced events
        
    - Clear visual distinction between automatically synced and manually tagged events
        
4. Sync Management Interface:
    
    - Settings page in NetSuite to configure sync criteria and default behaviors
        
    - Option to view sync history and manually trigger syncs if needed
