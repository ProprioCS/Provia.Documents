## Overview

The NetSuite Permissions System is designed to provide a flexible and scalable solution for managing user permissions within the Provia suite. This system leverages NetSuite's custom records and fields to store permission data, with a RESTlet endpoint providing seamless access to permission information for both frontend React applications and NetSuite implementations.

The system enables granular control over feature access, including Smart Table functionality, Miller-Knoll quote tool integration, and order manager capabilities. By centralizing permission management and providing a consistent access mechanism, the system ensures secure and efficient permission handling across the platform.

## Solution Type

- Integration â€“ Custom NetSuite development with frontend integration capabilities
    

## User Stories

1. As a system administrator, I want to define and manage custom permissions for different roles, so that I can control access to specific features and functionality across the platform.
    
2. As a developer, I want to access user permissions through a standardized API endpoint, so that I can implement consistent permission-based feature access in both React frontend and NetSuite backend implementations.
    
3. As an end user, I want my available actions and views to automatically reflect my role permissions, so that I can efficiently access the features I'm authorized to use while maintaining system security.
    

## Success Metrics

1. Permission Management Efficiency
    
    - Successful implementation of the custom permission field on role records
        
    - Accurate mapping of permissions to specific features and actions
        
    - Easy administration and maintenance of permission settings
        
2. System Integration
    
    - Successful integration with existing NetSuite role management
        
    - Reliable permission data retrieval through the RESTlet endpoint
        
    - Consistent permission enforcement across frontend and backend systems
        
3. Performance
    
    - RESTlet response time under 500ms for permission retrieval
        
    - Efficient caching of permission data where appropriate
        
    - Minimal impact on system performance when checking permissions
        
4. Security
    
    - Proper validation of user access rights
        
    - Secure transmission of permission data
        
    - Complete audit trail of permission changes
