## ==Quote-to-Sales Order Deposit Management==

## Overview

The Quote-to-Sales Order Deposit Management solution addresses a crucial need in the contract furniture dealer industry by enabling dealers to capture deposits on quotes rather than sales orders. This customization allows for a more flexible and customer-friendly sales process, where deposits can be taken earlier in the sales cycle. The solution seamlessly transitions the deposit from the quote stage to the sales order, ensuring accurate financial tracking and improved cash flow management.

Key benefits include:

1. Earlier capture of customer commitment through deposits
    
2. Streamlined transition from quote to sales order
    
3. Improved financial tracking and reporting
    
4. Enhanced cash flow management for dealers

## Technical Considerations

1. Scripting Approach:
    
    - Implement the Quote Deposit button using a script rather than a workflow for better control and performance.
        
2. Sales Order Creation Process:
    
    - The script to link the Customer Deposit to the Sales Order must run after the Sales Order is committed to the database.
        
    - Consider the impact on user experience due to potential increased save time for Sales Orders.
        
    - Evaluate whether to implement this as a scheduled script or a user event script, weighing performance against real-time updates.
        
3. Deposit Amount Calculation:
    
    - ==Initially, allow manual entry of the deposit amount by the user when creating the Customer Deposit.==
        
    - ==Design the solution to be flexible enough to accommodate future implementation of either a deposit percentage field or an invoice schedule for automatic calculation.==
        
4. Custom Quote Number Field:
    
    - ==Implement field validation to ensure only Quote transaction types can be entered in this field, preventing accidental association with other transaction types.==
        
5. Performance Optimization:
    
    - Optimize the query that checks for existing Customer Deposits when creating a Sales Order to minimize impact on system performance.
        
6. Data Integrity:
    
    - Implement checks to prevent duplicate Customer Deposits for the same Quote.
        
    - Ensure proper error handling if a Quote is deleted after a Customer Deposit has been created.
        
7. Scalability:
    
    - Design the solution to handle a potentially large number of quotes and deposits without significant performance degradation.
        
8. Integration with Existing Systems:
    
    - Ensure compatibility with existing NetSuite customizations and other Orion components.
        
9. Security:
    
    - Implement proper access controls to ensure that only authorized users can create and modify Customer Deposits.
        
10. Audit Trail:
    
    - Consider implementing a log of all actions related to Quote Deposits for auditing purposes.
        

## Testing and Quality Assurance

Test Script Title: Quote-to-Sales Order Deposit Management Test Script

Test Objectives:

1. Verify the accurate creation and association of Customer Deposits with Quotes
    
2. Ensure proper linking of Customer Deposits to Sales Orders upon creation
    
3. Validate the system's performance and user experience throughout the deposit process
    

Test Environment:

- Primary: NetSuite Sandbox environment

Test Data:

- Create a set of test Quotes with varying total amounts and customer information
    
- Prepare sample PO numbers for testing the custom search functionality
    
- Set up test customer accounts with different characteristics (e.g., payment terms, credit limits)
    

Test Steps:

1. Create a Quote and initiate the Deposit process Expected Result: Customer Deposit record is created with correct pre-populated information
    
2. Manually adjust deposit amount and save Customer Deposit Expected Result: System allows adjustment and saves accurately
    
3. Convert Quote to Sales Order Expected Result: Existing Customer Deposit is automatically associated with the new Sales Order
    
4. Search for Quote using PO number in custom search form Expected Result: Correct Quote is retrieved based on PO number
    
5. Attempt to create multiple deposits for the same Quote Expected Result: System prevents duplicate deposits or provides appropriate warning
