## Overview

The proposed solution aims to enhance Orion's project management capabilities by introducing a visual Gantt chart feature that integrates with NetSuite's native task records. This functionality will allow contract furniture dealers to create, manage, and visualize project timelines while maintaining the flexibility to handle both internal project management needs and client-facing presentations. The solution leverages existing NetSuite task records with additional custom fields to support hierarchical task relationships, dependencies, and milestone tracking.

A key differentiator of this solution is its ability to generate both interactive web-based Gantt charts and professionally branded PDF exports for client communication. By extending NetSuite's native task functionality rather than creating a separate project management system, the solution maintains data consistency while providing the visual project management tools that furniture dealers require for complex installation and logistics management.

## Solution Type

Module - This solution requires significant UI development, integrates with external libraries for visualization, involves complex data relationships, needs extensive customization of existing NetSuite functionality, and includes PDF generation capabilities.

## User Stories

1. As a Project Manager, I can create hierarchical task structures with dependencies and milestones, allowing me to visually map out complex installation projects and automatically adjust dependent task dates when changes occur.
    
2. As an Account Manager, I can generate branded PDF Gantt charts for my clients, enabling me to professionally communicate project timelines and progress while maintaining consistent branding across divisions.
    
3. As a Project Team Member, I can track time against parent tasks in the Gantt chart, allowing me to efficiently log my hours without the complexity of tracking against numerous subtasks.
    

## Success Metrics

1. Timeline Accuracy: Reduction in project timeline adjustments required after initial setup, measured by comparing number of manual date adjustments before and after implementation
    
2. Time Tracking Efficiency: Decrease in time tracking administrative overhead through consolidated parent-task tracking, measured by comparing time entry corrections and adjustments
    
3. Client Communication: Increase in client satisfaction with project visibility, measured through feedback on Gantt chart deliverables
    
4. Project Management Efficiency: Reduction in external project management tool licenses needed (e.g., Microsoft Project), measured by license cost savings
    

## Industry Examples & Best Practices

Based on real-world implementation examples shared during initial solution design meeting:

### Time Tracking Implementation Example

- Large-scale project example with 64 tasks demonstrated the need for hierarchical time tracking
    
- Simplified time entry by restricting tracking to parent tasks only, with automatic roll-up from child tasks
    
- Role-based task visibility (e.g., Design Director only seeing relevant design tasks)
    
- Demonstrated importance of skill-based task assignments
    

### Project Management Tool Analysis

- Referenced Microsoft Project features as baseline functionality
    
- Showcased various dependency and lag relationship types needed in furniture industry
    
- Illustrated need for flexible timeline visualization with milestone tracking

## Technical Considerations

### Key Technical Points:

1. Task Record Modifications:

    - Record-to-record relationships for dependencies
        
    - Parent-child relationship field using NetSuite's native record hierarchy capabilities
        
2. Performance Considerations:
    
    - Client-side scripting for dependency updates to handle cascading changes
        
    - JSON table for real-time updates before record commits
        
    - Optimization needed for PDF generation with large task sets
        
3. Integration Requirements:
    
    - SVAR Gantt React library implementation
        
    - NetSuite Advanced PDF/HTML Templates
        
    - Native time tracking functionality

- Browser compatibility for Gantt visualization
    
- PDF export formatting limitations
    
- NetSuite edition-specific feature availability
    
- Time tracking availability based on license level
