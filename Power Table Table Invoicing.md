## Smart Table Invoicing

## Solution Overview

The Smart Table Invoice Management solution enhances Provia's core transaction processing capabilities by providing an integrated interface for invoice creation and data manipulation directly within the Smart Table. This comprehensive solution enables users to generate invoices from selected lines, perform bulk data operations including quantity adjustments and column data transfers, while maintaining proper revenue recognition and accounting accuracy.

The solution streamlines complex billing workflows through intelligent handling of constituted lines, progressive billing scenarios, and flexible data management tools - all accessible through Provia's familiar Smart Table interface. By integrating these capabilities directly into the dealer's primary workspace, it significantly reduces manual effort while ensuring data integrity across NetSuite transactions.

## Solution Type

Module - This solution provides extensive new functionality that:

- Extends core Smart Table functionality with complex new features
    
- Involves transaction creation and JSON data manipulation
    
- Requires integration with multiple NetSuite components (sales orders, invoices, line constitution)
    
- Contains several interconnected features (invoice creation, bulk operations, data copying)
    
- Impacts critical business processes and revenue recognition
    

## User Stories

1. "As an Operations Admin, I want to select specific constituted lines from a sales order and generate an invoice, so that I can process partial shipment billing efficiently."
    
2. "As a Project Manager, I want to apply a percentage split (e.g., 33%) across selected line quantities, so that I can process progressive billing according to contract terms."
    
3. "As an Accounting Manager, I want to copy data between Smart Table columns in bulk, so that I can efficiently manage contract numbers and cost/sell values across multiple lines."
    

## Success Metrics

1. Time Reduction: 50% decrease in time required to generate partial invoices compared to manual line-by-line processing
    
2. Error Reduction: 90% reduction in billing errors related to progressive invoicing and quantity calculations
    
3. User Adoption: 80% of users utilizing the Smart Table invoice generation instead of traditional NetSuite invoice creation within 3 months
    
4. Process Efficiency: 75% reduction in clicks/steps required to generate partial invoices from sales orders
    
5. Data Accuracy: 100% match between Smart Table data and NetSuite transaction line items after bulk operations
    

## Design

### Interface Components

1. Main Smart Table
    
    - Row selection functionality for invoice line items
        
    - "Create" dropdown button (only available when not in edit mode)
        
    - Invoice creation option appears in dropdown for constituted lines only
        
    - Line status indicators for constituted vs non-constituted lines
        
2. Bulk Operations Bar
    
    - Located on right side of Smart Table
        
    - Contains percentage adjustment and column copy functions
        
    - Modal interface for column operations
        
3. Invoice Creation Flow
    
    - Transform selected lines to new invoice transaction
        
    - Opens invoice in edit mode automatically
        
    - PDF composer available after save
        

Supporting design documents should include mockups for:

- Column copy/paste modal with From/To fields
    
- Percentage adjustment interface
    
- Line selection and status indicators

## Features and Functionality

### User Actions:

- Select specific lines in Smart Table for invoicing
    
- Filter and view constituted lines
    
- Apply percentage adjustments to quantities
    
- Copy/paste data between columns
    
- Generate invoice from selected lines
    
- Save invoice and generate PDF
    

### Automations:

- Automatic line constitution validation before invoice creation
    
- Transform selected lines to invoice transaction
    
- Auto-population of new invoice with selected line data
    
- Opening of new invoice in edit mode
    
- Automatic decimal quantity calculations for percentage splits
    
- PDF composer availability after invoice save
    

### Constraints:

- Only constituted lines can be invoiced
    
- Partial invoicing requires constituted lines
    
- Single column copy/paste operations only
    
- Changes lost if view changed during copy/paste operation
    

## Technical Considerations

### Core Requirements:

- Smart Table JSON data must stay synchronized with NetSuite transaction line items
    
- Lines must be constituted before invoicing
    
- Support for decimal quantities in JSON data
    
- Handle relationship between Smart Table line numbers and NetSuite line IDs
    

### System Integration:

- Integration with existing NetSuite invoice creation process
    
- Integration with PDF composer
    
- Maintain existing line constitution process
    
- Support for native NetSuite fulfillment and revenue recognition
    

### Performance Considerations:

- Handle large line item sets efficiently
    
- Manage column copy/paste operations in single session scope
    
- Optimize bulk percentage calculations
    
- Consider performance impact of line constitution
    

### Data Management:

- Maintain data integrity during partial invoice creation
    
- Handle decimal quantity precision
    
- Support progressive billing calculations
    
- Preserve line item relationships across transactions
