## Overview

The Outlook to NetSuite mail sync is a process by which users can choose to connect emails which come in (or get sent from) their outlook account to records in netsuite. Once the user opens the email - they should be presented with an interface in outlook for selecting records which may relate to that message (i.e. Contacts, Customers, Opportunities, Projects, etc.).

## User Stories

1. As a sales representative at a contract furniture dealership, I want to easily sync email communications and attachments from Outlook to relevant NetSuite records (such as opportunities or sales orders), so that my team can access a complete history of customer interactions, enabling better collaboration, informed decision-making, and seamless customer service.
    
2. As a customer service manager, I want to review all customer communications related to a specific order or complaint, including emails and attachments synced from Outlook to NetSuite, so that I can quickly understand the context and provide informed, timely responses to escalated issues.
    
3. As a project coordinator, I want to create new customer or contact records in NetSuite directly from Outlook emails when communicating with potential leads, so that I can efficiently manage new business opportunities without switching between applications or duplicating data entry.

## Technical Considerations

1. File Storage Limitations:
    
    - Attachments synced from Outlook are stored in NetSuite's file cabinet
        
    - This impacts the overall file storage limits of the NetSuite account
        
    - Monitoring and management of file storage usage is crucial
        
2. Attachment Size Restrictions:
    
    - Emails with attachments exceeding NetSuite's message record size limitations cannot be automatically synced
        
    - Users need an option to sync emails without attachments
        
    - For oversized attachments, a manual process for storing files in NetSuite's file tab is required
        
3. User Setup and Authentication:
    
    - Each user requires individual setup of the SuperSync app in their Outlook
        
    - Proper authentication and authorization protocols between Outlook and NetSuite must be established for each user
        
4. API Considerations:
    
    - Adherence to NetSuite API governance and usage limits
        
    - Efficient API calls to prevent performance issues during high-volume syncing
        
5. Data Security and Privacy:
    
    - Ensuring secure transmission of data between Outlook and NetSuite
        
    - Compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) for email content and attachments
        
6. Performance Optimization:
    
    - Strategies for handling large volumes of emails and attachments without impacting system performance
        
    - Consideration of batch processing for bulk syncing operations
