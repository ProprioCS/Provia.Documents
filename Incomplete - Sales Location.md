## Overview

The Sales Location Custom Segment is a key component of Orion, designed to address the complex operational structure of contract furniture dealers. This solution enables dealers to track and manage sales across multiple markets, states, or regions, each potentially associated with unique dealer numbers and vendor relationships.

A Sales Location can be independent of the Location that stores inventory. Dealers may have multiple Locations per Sales Location or multiple Sales Locations can share a single Location for inventory - but will need WIP reporting to be differentiated by Sales Location.

This custom segment facilitates accurate sales tracking, commission calculations, and performance analysis across different locations. It also supports compliance with manufacturer-defined rules of engagement, such as state-specific business restrictions. Furthermore, the solution provides flexibility for dealers undergoing mergers and acquisitions, allowing for separate tracking of sales locations during transition periods.

By implementing the Sales Location Custom Segment, dealers can effectively manage their multi-location operations, maintain compliance with vendor requirements, and gain deeper insights into their business performance across various markets.

## User Stories

1. As a CFO, I want to view reports on Orders Booked, Backlog, and Cash Flow projections segmented by Sales Location, so that I can assess the financial performance of each of our 5 Sales Locations across 4 states.
    
2. As a Sales Manager responsible for multiple Sales Locations, I want to manage and analyze the sales pipeline separately for each Sales Location, so that I can effectively track and improve sales performance in my areas of responsibility.
    
3. As an Admin or Manager, I need to control user access to specific Sales Locations, ensuring that some employees (e.g., certain Account Coordinators) have access to all locations while others are restricted to their assigned locations.
    
4. As an Account Coordinator, I need to select the appropriate Sales Location on my transactions, and have the system automatically populate the corresponding vendor or dealer number on purchase orders.
    
5. As a Warehouse Manager of a Location, I need to be able to run reports of product in my warehouse separated by Sales Location for insurance purposes.
