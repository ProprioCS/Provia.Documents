The Provia Intellilock is a crucial component designed to prevent data conflicts and ensure data integrity within NetSuite for contract furniture dealers. This system implements a lightweight, yet robust mechanism to manage concurrent access to records, particularly those utilizing SmartTables with attached JSON files.

The solution prevents multiple users from simultaneously editing the same record, mitigating the risk of data loss or inconsistencies. It includes features such as user notifications, timed lock expiration, and an override capability for authorized users, striking a balance between data protection and workflow flexibility.

## Solution Type

Utilities

## User Stories

1. As a sales representative, I want to be notified if a record I'm trying to edit is already being modified by another user, so that I can avoid potential data conflicts and coordinate with my colleague if necessary.
    
2. As a sales supervisor, I need the ability to override and unlock a locked record when necessary, so that I can manage urgent changes or resolve stuck processes without delays.
    
3. As a system administrator, I want records to automatically unlock after a period of inactivity, so that forgotten locks don't impede workflow and users can access needed information even if someone forgets to release their lock.
    

## Success Metrics

1. Lock Creation Speed: The system creates a lock record within 500 milliseconds of a user entering edit mode, ensuring minimal delay to user workflow.
    
2. Lock Visibility: 100% of users attempting to access a locked record in view mode can see who is currently editing it.
    
3. Conflict Prevention Rate: Zero instances of simultaneous editing on the same record, measured over a 30-day period.
    
4. Lock Override Effectiveness: 95% success rate for authorized users overriding locks and causing the original editor to exit edit mode.
    
5. User Experience: Less than 5% of users report workflow disruptions due to the locking system in monthly satisfaction surveys.
    

## Design

The Provia SmartLock system integrates seamlessly with the existing NetSuite interface, utilizing native NetSuite components for a consistent user experience. Key design elements include:

1. Lock Notification: Utilize NetSuite's messaging/alert module to display a prominent warning when a user views a record that is currently being edited.
    
2. Edit Attempt Handling: Automatically redirect users to view mode if they attempt to edit a locked record.
    
3. Unlock Button: For users with appropriate permissions, display an "Unlock Record" button on the view page of a locked record.
    
4. Edit Mode Exit: When a user loses their lock (due to timeout or override), automatically redirect them from edit mode to view mode.
    
5. User Feedback: Implement clear, non-intrusive notifications for all locking and unlocking actions to keep users informed of the record's status.
    

## Roles and Permissions

The system uses NetSuite's native permission system, checking user permissions on the Provia Lock custom record to determine access levels for various operations. This replaces the originally defined role-based permissions with a more flexible, permission-based approach.

Permissions are now determined by the user's access level to the Provia Lock custom record:

- View: Ability to see lock information
    
- Edit: Ability to create and release own locks
    
- Full: Ability to override and force-unlock records
    

## Features and Functionality

- Automatic Lock Creation: System automatically creates a lock when a user enters edit mode on a record
    
- Lock Visibility: Users viewing a locked record see a warning message indicating who is currently editing
    
- Edit Prevention: System redirects users to view mode if they attempt to edit a locked record
    
- Lock Override: Authorized users can force-unlock a record via an "Unlock Record" button
    
- Automatic Lock Expiration: Locks automatically expire after a set period of inactivity
    
- User Notifications: Real-time notifications for lock creation, override attempts, and expirations
    
- Record Edit History: System logs all lock-related actions for auditing purposes
    
- Lock Management Interface: Admins can view current locks, force unlocks, and adjust system settings
    
- Integration with SmartTable: Locking system specifically protects SmartTable-enabled records and associated JSON files
    
- Performance Optimization: Lock creation and checking processes designed for minimal impact on system performance
    

## Technical Implementation

### Custom Objects and Scripts

1. Custom Record: Provia Lock (customrecord_provia_lock)
    
    - Fields:
        
        - Record ID (List/Record)
            
        - Record Type (Text)
            
        - User (List/Employee)
            
        - Lock Time (Date/Time)
            
        - Expiration Time (Date/Time)
            
        - Status (List: Active, Expired, Released)
            
2. Scripts:
    
    - ProviaSmartLockUtils Module: Centralized utility functions for permission checking, lock operations, and RESTlet calls
        
    - Provia SmartLock RESTlet: Handles API requests for lock management operations
        
    - Provia SmartLock User Event Script: Manages lock warnings and actions on record load
        
    - Provia SmartLock Dashboard Portlet: Provides an admin interface for viewing and managing locks
        
    - Provia SmartLock Dashboard Client Script: Handles user interactions on the admin dashboard
        
    - Provia SmartLock Record Client Script: Manages unlock functionality from individual record pages
        
    - Provia SmartLock Scheduled Script: Performs regular maintenance tasks like expiring old locks
        

### Key Technical Functions

The system uses SuiteScript 2.0 for optimal performance and compatibility. It leverages SuiteQL for efficient database operations and includes error logging for easier troubleshooting. Key functions include:

1. Lock Creation
    
2. Lock Check
    
3. Lock Release
    
4. Force Unlock
    
5. Permission Check
    

## Testing and Quality Assurance

A comprehensive testing strategy should be implemented, including:

- Unit tests for individual functions
    
- Integration tests for the entire system
    
- Performance testing with realistic data volumes
    
- User acceptance testing
