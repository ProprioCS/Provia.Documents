## ==Proforma Invoice Solution Design==

## Overview

The proforma invoice solution is designed to enhance the order management process for contract furniture dealers using NetSuite. This custom component will allow users to generate, track, and manage proforma invoices (requests for deposits) directly within the NetSuite environment. The solution aims to provide better visibility into expected deposits, improve cash flow management, and streamline the order-to-cash process.

Key benefits include:

1. Improved tracking of requested deposits
    
2. Enhanced cash flow visibility
    
3. Streamlined process for generating and managing proforma invoices
    
4. Better integration with existing NetSuite transactions and records
