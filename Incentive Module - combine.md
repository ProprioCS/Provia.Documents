## Overview

The Orion Commission Module revolutionizes commission management for contract furniture dealers by introducing a project-centric approach that aligns with modern project management practices. Moving beyond traditional line-by-line calculations, this module provides a comprehensive commission framework that automatically calculates commissions based on project-level gross profit, incorporating both actual and estimated data throughout the project lifecycle.

The module features an intelligent calculation engine that automatically triggers commission calculations based on configurable events and performs true-ups as projects progress. Its flexible commission plan architecture supports a hierarchical rule system that accommodates complex commission scenarios while preventing manipulation through strategic order splitting.

The module introduces a relative-to calculation framework that determines commission amounts based on the proportion of total project sell represented by each triggering document, while always using the project's overall GP for rate determination. This approach ensures fair commission distribution throughout the project lifecycle while preventing manipulation through strategic order splitting.

## Solution Type

Module â€“ This is an extensive functionality module that includes:

- Commission calculation framework
    
- Integration with project management
    
- Complex business rules engine
    
- Automated workflows

## User Stories

1. "As a salesperson, I want to see my projected and approved commissions for each project in real-time so I can track my earnings and focus my efforts effectively."
    
2. "As a sales manager, I want to review and approve commission calculations before payment processing so I can ensure accuracy and handle any special circumstances."
    
3. "As a controller, I want the system to automatically calculate true-ups and clawbacks based on project changes and payment status so I can maintain accurate commission records without manual intervention."
    
4. "As a sales operations manager, I want to configure different commission plans with varying rates, thresholds, and rules so I can implement complex compensation structures across different divisions and scenarios."
    
5. "As a project manager, I want to mark specific lines or transactions as non-commissionable so I can properly handle warranty work, internal costs, and other special cases that shouldn't affect commission calculations."
    
6. "As an accounting manager, I want the system to calculate commissions based on the project's sales team structure and automatically handle splits between primary and secondary sales representatives so I can ensure fair compensation distribution."
    
7. "As a CFO, I want visibility into commission calculations at both the master project and sub-project levels so I can analyze commission expenses across different business units and project types."
    
8. "As a sales operations manager, I want to configure multiple commission calculation triggers per plan so I can automate initial payments and true-ups at different project stages."
    
9. "As a controller, I want the system to automatically handle negative GP scenarios with appropriate clawbacks so I can maintain accurate commission payments."
    
10. "As an administrator, I want to prevent overlapping commission plans while allowing multiple plans across different locations/subsidiaries."
    
11. "As a commission administrator, I need to specify priorities for commission plans to handle cases where multiple plans could apply to ensure the correct plan is selected automatically."
    
12. "As a commission administrator, I want commission plans to be copied and timestamped when applied to projects so that subsequent changes to the original commission plan don't affect existing projects."
    
13. "As a commission administrator, I need flexible expiration date options for commission plans to support both indefinite and time-bound commission structures."
    
14. "As a commission administrator, I need to control which lines affect commission GP calculations to properly handle special cases and non-commissionable items."
