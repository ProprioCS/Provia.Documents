## Overview

The proposed solution for the Order Team in Provia is designed to streamline the assignment and tracking of team members working on specific orders within a dealer. The main purpose of this solution is to enhance collaboration, communication, and efficiency among team members by providing a clear indication of who is responsible for each aspect of an order, from the initial Opportunity stage through the Quote and Sales Order stages.

Key benefits for MillerKnoll dealers include:

1. Improved visibility into order assignments, enabling team members to quickly identify their responsibilities and collaborate effectively throughout the order lifecycle.
    
2. Enhanced accountability and task management, as team members will receive reminders and dashboard updates based on their assigned orders, ensuring that critical tasks are completed on time.
    
3. Streamlined order processing, with Order Team information automatically carrying over from one transaction to another (Opportunity, Quote, Sales Order), reducing manual data entry and minimizing the risk of errors.
    
4. Increased flexibility in team assignments, allowing dealers to establish pre-defined teams for specific customers or internal groups, as well as the ability to select multiple users for each role on the Order Team, accommodating various project requirements and resource availability.
    
5. Improved customer service, as the clear assignment of responsibilities and enhanced communication among team members will lead to faster issue resolution and more timely order fulfillment.

## Success Metrics

1. Reduction in order processing time: Measure the average time it takes to process an order from the initial Opportunity stage to the final Sales Order stage before and after implementing the Order Team Navigator solution. A significant reduction in order processing time will indicate the solution's effectiveness in streamlining the order process.
    
2. Increase in on-time project delivery: Track the percentage of projects delivered on or before the agreed-upon deadline before and after implementing the Order Team Navigator. An increase in on-time project delivery will demonstrate the solution's impact on improving team efficiency and collaboration.

Improvement in team collaboration and communication: Conduct surveys or gather feedback from team members to assess their perception of collaboration and communication within the Order Team before and after implementing the solution. Positive feedback and a notable improvement in team dynamics will indicate the solution's success in fostering better collaboration and communication.
    
4. Decrease in order-related errors or discrepancies: Monitor the number of order-related errors, discrepancies, or rework needed before and after implementing the Order Team Navigator. A significant decrease in these issues will show the solution's effectiveness in reducing manual errors and improving overall order accuracy.
    

## Design

As an experienced NetSuite Solution Architect, I recommend the following UI/UX design elements for the Order Team utility in Provia:

1. Order Team Sublist:
    
    - Create a new sublist called "Order Team" on the Opportunity, Quote, and Sales Order transactions.
        
    - Include columns for "Role," "Assigned Users," and "Primary Contact" within the sublist.
        
    - Allow multiple users to be selected for each role, with the ability to designate a primary contact.
        
    - Provide a search and select functionality to easily find and assign team members to roles.
        
    - _OR provide a way for the Order Team to be displayed in the Transaction header as this would be easier for people to navigate than having to access a sublist/subtab_
        
2. Role Configuration:
    
    - Develop a new setup page called "Order Team Roles" to define the available roles for the Order Team.
        
    - Allow administrators to create, edit, and delete roles based on their organization's requirements.
        
    - Include fields for "Role Name," "Description," and "Default Assigned Users" to streamline the assignment process.
        
3. Pre-defined Team Templates:
    
    - Create a new setup page called "Order Team Templates" to define pre-configured teams for specific customers or internal groups.
        
    - Allow administrators to create, edit, and delete team templates.
        
    - Include fields for "Template Name," "Description," and a sublist for assigning roles and users to the template.
        
    - Provide a dropdown on the Opportunity, Quote, and Sales Order transactions to select a pre-defined team template, automatically populating the Order Team sublist.
        
4. Automatic Data Flow:
    
    - Ensure that the Order Team information automatically carries over from the Opportunity to the Quote and from the Quote to the Sales Order.
        
    - Provide a visual indication (e.g., an icon or a message) to confirm that the Order Team data has been successfully transferred between transactions.
        
5. Default Order Team on Customer Record:
    
    - Users will have the option to set a default Order Team on a customer record.
        
    - When a new transaction is created for that customer, the default Order Team will be automatically populated, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency.
        
6. Dashboard and Reminders:
    
    - Ensure that all assigned transactions display on user role dashboards
        
    - Include filters for transaction type, status, and date range to help users quickly find the information they need.
        
    - Implement a reminder system that sends notifications to team members based on their assigned tasks and upcoming deadlines.
        
7. User Interface Enhancements:
    
    - Add a new "Order Team" tab on the Opportunity, Quote, and Sales Order transaction pages to prominently display the Order Team sublist.
        
    - Ensure that the Order Team sublist is easily accessible and visible without scrolling or navigating away from the main transaction view.
        
    - Use clear labels, tooltips, and help text to guide users through the process of assigning and managing the Order Team.
        
8. Reporting and Analytics:
    
    - Create a new "Order Team Performance Report" that provides insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of Order Teams.
        
    - Include metrics such as average order processing time, on-time completion rate, and customer satisfaction scores.
        
    - Allow users to drill down into specific orders and team members to identify areas for improvement and recognize high-performing teams.
