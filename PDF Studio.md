## Overview

The PDF Composer is a NetSuite-integrated solution designed to enable contract furniture dealers to create customized, professional-looking PDF documents for various transactions, such as quotes, customer acknowledgments, and invoices. The main purpose of this solution is to meet customer requirements and user preferences by providing a user-friendly interface for selecting and customizing PDF document options. Key benefits include increased efficiency in generating professional documents, improved customer satisfaction through personalized and visually appealing PDFs, and maintaining a consistent brand image across all customer-facing documents.

## Solution Type

## User Stories

1. As a sales admin or salesperson, I want to be able to select the set of components to include on my PDF document according to the customer and project needs, so that I can generate tailored and relevant documents for each client.
    
2. As a member of the marketing team, I want to be able to upload and manage a variety of cover page options for quotes, so that I can maintain a consistent and professional brand image across all customer-facing documents generated by the sales team.
    
3. As a project manager, I want to quickly generate a quote for a client with specific requirements by selecting the appropriate proposal format, header fields, and line items, so that I can efficiently provide a professional-looking document that meets the client's needs.
    
4. As an AR person, when I am ready to create the invoice for the sales order, i want my invoice PDF to automatically default to the same settings used for the original quote pdf (this is typically a dealer customer mandate - so when they compare the invoice to the quote they include the same data and columns and have the same format.)
    

## Success Metrics

1. Reduce the average time spent on creating and customizing PDF documents for quotes, customer acknowledgments, and invoices by 50% within the first three months of implementation.
    
2. Improve the overall sales cycle efficiency by reducing the time between quote generation and customer acceptance by 20% within the first quarter of using the PDF Composer.
    
3. Improve customer satisfaction by providing documents in the format they prefer for easier transaction management.
    
4. Ensure that 100% of the PDF documents generated through the PDF Composer adhere to the company's brand guidelines and visual standards, as measured by monthly audits conducted by the marketing team.
    

## Design

The PDF Composer will be accessible through a pop-up or guided interface within the Quotes, Customer Acknowledgments, and Invoices sections of NetSuite. The interface will allow users to select various options for creating custom PDF documents.

Key UI/UX elements:

1. Cover Page Selection:
    

- Dealers can upload and manage cover page options
    
- Users can select the desired cover page for each document
    

2. Proposal Format Options:
    

- Users can choose from predefined proposal formats, such as:
    
- Groups (Tags)/Subtotals Only with images per Group
    
- Groups (Tags)/Subtotals Only without images
    
- Groups (Tags)/Subtotals AND Lines with images per Group
    
- Groups (Tags)/Subtotals AND Lines without images
    
- Lines Only
    
- All formats will include a header field
    

3. Header Fields:
    

- Users can select header fields from a pre-selected list in a dialog box
    
- Some fields will be defined as default and cannot be deselected (e.g., Bill Address, Bill Contact, Install Address, Install Contact)
    
- Optional fields will appear in a consistent "zone" on the document
    

4. Line Fields/Columns:
    

- Users can select which line fields/columns to include (e.g., product#, description, tag or group, qty, unit list, unit sell, customer discount %, total sell price)
    
- Selected fields will appear in a set order to maintain consistency
    

5. Calculated Fields:
    

- Users can select calculated fields (e.g., subtotals, deposit % required, sales tax, financing program calculations) to include in the footer section or end of the product line detail section
    

6. Field Population:
    

- Values stored in other records (e.g., deposit % required from Customer Record, terms and conditions type, leasing terms from Vendor Record) will appear in the selection boxes
    

7. Default Preferences:
    

- Dealers can set default preferences for the PDF Composer
    
    - by Customer (it is generally the Customer who dictates how they want their Quotes/Proposals to be structured, and which options they should contain.)
        
    - by User (wish list)
        

 8. Layout Management:

- Users can save created layouts for future use
    
- Layouts and any option values can be stored in a custom records that links them to customers, so that the next Quote/Proposal for that Customer will default to all the specified settings. 
    

9. Print Preview:
    

- Users will have access to a print preview option to review the PDF before finalizing

    1. The PDF Composer automatically generates a professional-looking PDF document based on the selected options and layout
        
12. Customer Acknowledgment Email Template option
    
    1. Create a NetSuite email template for Customer Acknowledgments that can be automated once a Sales Order has been updated with Vendor Acknowledgement data.
        
    2. The email template should include the ship date information and other relevant details from the Sales Order.
        
13. **LEAF Financing Option** - this is a somewhat special option they can include on a Quote/Proposal. If checked, the PDF will include a section with information about how the dealer can choose to finance the order through LEAF Financial, as well as a calculated typical monthly payment based on stored rate tiers.
    
    1. Required Data for LEAF
        
        1. **The Rates and Tiers**. There have historically been 4 of them. Each includes an up to dollar amount and a decimal rate. For example:
            
            1. 5000.00 - 9999.9 : 0.02143
                
            2. 10000.00 - 24999.99 : 0.02076
                
            3. 25000 - 49999.99 : 0.02070
                
            4. 50000 - up : 0.02066
                
        2. What these mean, for example, is if the total pre-tax amount on the Quote is $20000.00, it would be multiplied by the 2nd rate, 0.02076, and display a typical monthly payment of $415.20.
            
        3. The LEAF API (documentation coming from LEAF) will allow us to get the specific dealer’s rates automatically by including the dealer number in the API call. We do not yet know if LEAF maintains their own dealer number for each dealer, or if they use the MillerKnoll dealer numbers. A good way to handle this would be to create a custom record or custom fields to store the rates, and have a nightly scheduled script to call the LEAF API to see if the rates have changed. This way when we are creating a Quote PDF, we do not need to call an external API.
            
        4. There is a minimum floor also - currently no Quote whose pre-tax total is < $5000.00 qualifies for the program. Therefore, regardless of whether the dealer user checks the LEAF Financing checkbox, the PDF should not contain this section if the amount is less than the floor.
            
    2. Here is an existing example of what the LEAF section may look like on the PDF:
        
    3. The specific wording can be customized by an admin.
        
    4. The LEAF block is usually placed after the signature lines, but before any Terms & Conditions. We may want to make this an adminable setting also.
        
    5. The LEAF block should not be available for Invoice PDFs, even if it existed on the Quote PDF.
        
    6. The LEAF API also supports submitting a credit app to them. If the dealer wants their customer to be able to do that from a Quote, we will need to provide an option for this (some dealers may want to control this process - we will need to see.)

## Technical Considerations
